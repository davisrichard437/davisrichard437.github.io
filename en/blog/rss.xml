    I'm a nerd.
    One of the things I'm a nerd about is music; another is computer science.
    Only very rarely do the two meet, as they did in a recent piece I wrote.
    In this post I'll talk a little bit about a piece I wrote based on the concept of a linked list.

    I'm very gradually switching to LilyPond as my main notation software.
    As part of this, I'm trying to optimize my workflow as much as possible so as to minimize overall pain.
    One way to do so is with scheme <a href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.25/Documentation/notation/substitution-function-syntax">music functions</a>, which enable the programmer to substitute arguments into a music expression.
    This is incredibly powerful, but it does have its limitations, the main one being that it can only return music, not a score or something like that.
    </p>

    <p>
    That's where this post comes in.
    I've developed a fun workaround that allows for calling a function-like object and getting back something that is not strictly music.

    I'm a nerd.
    One of the things I'm a nerd about is Emacs, the extensible text editor.
    Emacs does basically everything for me: I can listen to music, browse the web, read and send email, chat over multiple protocols, read and write PDF documents, etc.
    (Notice that I didn't even explicitly mention writing text!)
    One new thing that I have made Emacs do for me is build this website.
    This proved harder than I expected, so I'll share some takeaways from the process.

    Salutations all!

    <p>
    My name is Richard Davis.
    I'll be using this blog to talk about things that are interesting to me.
    This primarily refers to music and tech, though there could be a couple miscellaneous things sprinkled in here and there.
    </p>

    <p>
    I hope you enjoy!
