* About

Salutations!
My name is Richard Davis.
I am a Montreal- and Massachusetts-based composer, viola performer, and teacher.
My primary compositional interests are intertextuality, live electronics, vocal or vocal-emulating music, and computer-assisted composition.
With viola, I specialize in contemporary music performance.

** Miscellaneous

Some might be interested in my [[https://gitlab.com/davisrichard437][GitLab]], which has a number of Python scripts I've written in the past for various computer-assisted composition tasks.
I also have a [[https://github.com/davisrichard437][GitHub]], but this is secondary and primarily for collaboration with others.
